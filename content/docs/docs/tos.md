## Data Storage and Privacy Protection

Data storage strategies are contingent upon the user's operational state.

### Storage Conditions While Logged Out

- For users who have not logged into an account, data such as personal preference settings, marker progress, and filter states are **stored entirely within the local storage of the user's current browser (Local Storage / IndexedDB)**.
- Under this mode, switching devices, changing browsers, or activating incognito modes **will not inherit your data**. We advise guest users to periodically utilize the "Export/Import Data" feature for local backups.

### Storage Conditions While Logged In

- For users who have registered and logged into an account, their progress data and application settings will be **encrypted, synchronized, and stored in our D1 database** to enable cross-device interoperability.
- The developer team pledges that collected data (such as account identifiers, encrypted passwords, and encrypted game progress data) is **used exclusively to provide the map synchronization service**.
- This Project **will not** sell, share, or leak your personal data and operational logs to any third-party commercial entities.

### Data Security and Disclaimer

- The developer team employs industry-standard cryptographic measures to safeguard database security. However, given that this is a non-profit open-source project, we cannot provide guarantees of enterprise-grade absolute security.
- **In the event of data leaks or loss caused by force majeure, malicious hacker attacks, or third-party service (e.g., cloud provider) failures, this Project and its developer team shall be exempt from legal and financial indemnification liabilities.**

- The developer team makes no warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or stability of the service.

### Data Accuracy
- While the developer team endeavors to maintain accurate and updated data, due to game version iterations, official temporary hotfixes, or limitations in datamining, we do not guarantee the 100% accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of map markers, descriptions, routes, or information. This Project bears no responsibility for in-game decision-making errors resulting from map marker inaccuracies.

### Service Alteration and Termination
- This Project does not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.
- Due to server maintenance, cloud service provider fluctuations, CDN failures, or the **depletion of project funds**, the developer team reserves the right to modify, suspend, or permanently terminate any or all parts of the Services at any time without prior notice.

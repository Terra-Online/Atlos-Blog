title: API Terms of Use
description: API Terms of Use for Open Endfield Map.
---

Welcome to the Application Programming Interface (API) provided by **Open Endfield Map** (hereinafter referred to as "we", "this Project", or "OEM"). By accessing, integrating, or utilizing the OEM API in any manner, you ("Developer" or "you") signify that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by the full legal force of these *API Terms of Use* (hereinafter referred to as "these Terms"). If you do not agree to any provision of these Terms, you must immediately cease all access to and use of this API.

## Account and Access Credentials
1. **Credential Security**: If OEM assigns you an API Key or access token, you must maintain its strict confidentiality. You may not share, sell, transfer, or otherwise disclose your API credentials to any third party.
2. **Credential Responsibility**: You shall bear full responsibility for all activities that occur under your API credentials. Should you discover any compromise or unauthorized use of your credentials, you must notify us immediately.

## Permitted Use
You may access the OEM API for personal, educational, and non-commercial purposes. We encourage developers to build derivative tools that provide substantial innovative experiences based on OEM's existing data (e.g., game route planners, resource progression calculators, data analysis tools, Discord/QQ bots, etc.). Your application must provide **added value** to end users beyond the official OEM platform.

## Prohibited Use
When using the OEM API, the following actions are strictly prohibited:
1. **Any Form of Commercialization**: You may not utilize the OEM API or the data it provides to generate any direct or indirect revenue. This includes, but is not limited to: embedding advertisements within your application, establishing paywalls, mandating sponsorships/donations, or selling the application as paid software. Should you require commercial authorization, you must obtain prior written consent from the OEM team.
2. **Mirroring, Porting, or Replica Development**: You may not use this API to duplicate, display, or redistribute OEM's map content and interactive interfaces "as is". The development of replica or wrapper applications designed to replace or divert traffic from the official OEM website is strictly prohibited.
3. **Bulk Scraping and Dataset Resale**: You may not mass-download, scrape, or extract the underlying data of this API (such as comprehensive coordinate data or index texts) to serve as your independent offline dataset, nor may you redistribute such data via your own API.
4. **Abuse and Disruption**: You may not use this API in any manner that could disrupt, overload, or impair OEM's servers and networks (including but not limited to DDoS attacks, exploiting vulnerabilities to inject malicious code, etc.).

---

## Rate Limits and Caching Policies
1. **Compliance with Rate Limits**: You must adhere to the call frequency limits (Rate Limits) stipulated by OEM in the API response headers or official documentation. Circumventing these limits through multiple IP rotations, forged User-Agents, or other evasive technical means is strictly prohibited.
2. **Reasonable Caching**: To protect our server resources, you must implement reasonable local caching strategies within your application. Avoid high-frequency, repetitive requests for static or infrequently modified data.

## Intellectual Property and Brand Identity
1. **Data Ownership**: All ownership and intellectual property rights of the fundamental map data, image resources, marker information, and user-generated content (UGC) accessed through this API belong exclusively to Open Endfield Map and their respective contributors.
2. **Brand Boundaries**: Without prior written consent, you may not use "Open Endfield Map" or any confusingly similar names in your application name, logo, or domain name. You may not imply that your application is an "official product" of OEM or has received official endorsement from OEM.

## Attribution Requirements
If you build a public service utilizing this API, you must provide clear attribution in a prominent location within your application's interface (such as the footer or the "About" page), including an active hyperlink to the official OEM website.

## Privacy and User Data
If your application involves processing the personal information of end users, you must provide a legally compliant *Privacy Policy*. You may not use the OEM API to attempt to collect, decompile, or access the personal privacy data or account information of other users on the OEM platform.

## Termination and Access Revocation
OEM reserves the unilateral right to limit, suspend, or permanently terminate your API access privileges at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, reasonable suspicion of your violation of these Terms).

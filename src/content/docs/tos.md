## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using Open Endfield Map (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, you may not use the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

Open Endfield Map is a community-driven mapping platform focused on the fictional Endfield universe. Users may browse, contribute, and edit map data and annotations ("Content") within the rules set out here.

## 3. User Accounts

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. You agree not to share your credentials or allow others to access your account.

## 4. User-Generated Content (UGC)

### 4.2 Automated Moderation

**All user-generated content submitted to the Service is automatically screened by the [OpenAI Moderation API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation).** Content flagged as violating OpenAI's usage policies — including but not limited to harassment, hate speech, explicit material, or violent content — will be automatically rejected or removed before publication. This automated check operates in real time and supplements (but does not replace) human moderation.

- Illegal, defamatory, or fraudulent;
- Infringing of any third-party intellectual property rights;
- Hateful, threatening, or harassing;
- Spam or unsolicited commercial advertisements.

## 5. Intellectual Property

The Open Endfield Map name, logo, and site design are the property of the Open Endfield Map project. The game assets and lore referenced belong to their respective rights holders.

## 6. Termination

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at our sole discretion, with or without notice, for conduct that violates these Terms.

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Open Endfield Map shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of your use of the Service.
